# Arduino Uno Dual LED Blinker

This project demonstrates how to control two LEDs using an Arduino Uno and a breadboard. The LEDs alternate their blinking pattern, showing how digital pins can be used to control output devices.

## 🔧 Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard
- 2 x LEDs
- 2 x 220-ohm resistors
- Jumper wires

## ⚙️ Circuit Setup

- **LED 1 (connected to pin 8):**
  - Anode (long leg) → 220-ohm resistor → Arduino pin 8
  - Cathode (short leg) → GND

- **LED 2 (connected to pin 9):**
  - Anode (long leg) → 220-ohm resistor → Arduino pin 9
  - Cathode (short leg) → GND

## 🧠 How It Works

The code alternates between turning LED 1 on and LED 2 off, and vice versa, every second. This creates a blinking effect where only one LED is on at a time.
